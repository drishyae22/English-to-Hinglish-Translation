# English text to Hinglish Translation

This code translates the given English text into Hinglish using the OpenAI API. The translated text is saved to a new text file.

Note: There isn't a robust library available for converting English text into Hinglish. But we can train transformer models to achieve the task of translation. But due to timing constraints and less computational power, it wasn't possible. So I have used openai API for the translation task. 

# Overview
